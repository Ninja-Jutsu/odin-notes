        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <h3>You can think of 
            variables as simply “storage containers” for data in 
            your code.</h3>

        <h2>Variable naming</h2>
        <h3>There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:</h3>
        <p>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
            The first character must not be a digit.</p>

        <h2>Uppercase constants</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution.

            Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.</p>

    <h1>Numbers</h1>
    <h3>Adding Numbers and Strings</h3>
    <p>WARNING !!

        JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
        Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.</p>

    <h2>NaN - Not a Number</h2>
    
    <p>NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.
        Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number)</p>
        <img src="../img/js-screenshots/numbers1.png">
        <h3>However, if the string is numeric, the result will be a number:</h3>
        <img src="../img/js-screenshots/number2.png">
    <p>You can use the global JavaScript function isNaN() to find out if a value is a not a number:</p>

    <h1>Increment and decrement operators</h1>
    <p>For a start, note that you can't apply these directly to a number, which might seem strange, but we are assigning a variable a new updated value, not operating on the value itself.</p>

    <h1>Assignment = returns a value</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>All operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for + and -, but also true for =.
        The call x = value writes the value into x and then returns it.</p>
        <img src="../img/js-screenshots/numbers6.png">
    <p>In the example above, the result of expression (a = b + 1) is the value which was assigned to a (that is 3). It is then used for further evaluations.</p>

    <h1>Chaining assignments</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Chained assignments evaluate from right to left. First, the rightmost expression 2 + 2 is evaluated and then assigned to the variables on the left: c, b and a. At the end, all the variables share a single value.</p>

    <h1>Comma has a very low precedence</h1>
    
    <p>Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so parentheses are important in the example above.
        Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into a = 3, 7, then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored. It’s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.</p>
